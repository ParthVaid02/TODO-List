# To-Do List

A simple web-based To-Do List application that allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

- Delete tasks using the "Delete" button.
- Tasks are saved in local storage for persistence.
- Responsive design for better usability.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the application.

## How to Use
1. Open the application in a browser.
2. Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed (it will appear crossed out).
4. Use the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.
